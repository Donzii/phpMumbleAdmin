If your time log is incorrect with PMA even if you have set the right time zone, it's come from a murmur bug.

I've included a workaround but it's works only for linux as it's use the "date" system command.

If you're using another OS like windows, BSD, Mac etc... I'm interrest to adapte this workaround to your system.
Please contact me by email: PMA@ipnoz.net
